### **Getting Started**

Stacks Pay allows merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrency quickly and securely on the Stacks blockchain. Whether you're selling products, accepting donations, or invoicing clients, Stacks Pay generates encoded payment links or QR codes that your customers can use to make payments to your Stacks wallet.

Currently, **Boom Wallet** is the only wallet that supports generating Stacks Pay links, but any Stacks-compatible wallet (such as **Xverse** or **Leather**) can be used to receive payments. Additionally, payment links can be generated by store tools like **Boom Smart Shops**.



### **Step 1: Set Up Your Stacks Wallet**

Before you can begin accepting payments, you’ll need a Stacks wallet to receive funds. If you don’t already have one, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Wallet**: You can use any Stacks-compatible wallet to receive payments, such as [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/), [Leather](https://leather.io/), or [Boom Wallet](https://www.boomwallet.app).
   
2. **Create Your Wallet**: Download and install the wallet of your choice, then follow the instructions to create a new wallet. Make sure to safely store your recovery phrase, as it's essential for accessing your funds.

3. **Get Your Stacks Address**: After setting up your wallet, copy your Stacks address. It’s typically a long string starting with "SP" (e.g., `SP3FBR2AGK2YDB8XJ9THN4SR6J5SM8KW6QY6WEM9A`). This is the address you’ll use to receive payments.



### **Step 2: Create a Payment Request**

To accept payments, you’ll need to generate a Stacks Pay payment link. As of now, **Boom Wallet** is the only wallet that supports generating these encoded payment links. You can also use store tools like **Boom Smart Shops** to create payment links.

Here’s how to generate a Stacks Pay payment link:

1. **Use Boom Wallet**:
   - Open **Boom Wallet** and navigate to the payment request generation tool.
   - Enter the following information:
     - **Recipient**: Your Stacks address, where the payment will be sent.
     - **Amount**: The fixed amount (in STX or tokens) if you’re selling a product. For donations or open-ended payments, you can leave this blank, allowing the customer to enter their desired amount.
     - **Description**: A short description of the payment (e.g., “Payment for consulting services” or “Donation to support our nonprofit”).
     - **Stacks Pay ID (spId)**: Boom Wallet automatically generates a unique ID for the payment request, helping you track specific payments.
   
2. **Generate the Encoded Payment Link**:
   - Boom Wallet will create a Bech32m-encoded payment link based on the information provided.
   - **Note**: Stacks Pay URLs are always encoded to ensure compatibility, security, and error detection. The encoded URL will look something like:
     ```
     stxpay1qpz9eyarqj8guvs49epj7wp6rszpe6sczxsrdsgx5uqzgkx5fw
     ```
     This encoded link ensures that the payment details are securely transmitted to the customer’s wallet.

3. **Generate the QR Code (Optional)**:
   - If you’re handling in-person transactions or want to make it easier for mobile users, you can also generate a QR code from the payment link. Many tools, including Boom Wallet, offer the option to generate a QR code alongside the link.



### **Step 3: Share the Payment Request with Your Customer**

Once you’ve generated the Stacks Pay link or QR code, you can easily share it with your customers.

1. **Via Email or Messaging**:
   - Copy the encoded payment link from Boom Wallet and include it in an email or message to your customer.
   - Example: “Please click the link below to complete your payment: [Encoded Payment Link]”

2. **Embed on Your Website**:
   - If you run an online store, you can embed the payment link as a button on your website.
   - Example: Add a “Pay with Stacks” button that links to the encoded payment URL for a seamless customer experience.

3. **Use a QR Code for In-Person Payments**:
   - For mobile-first or in-person payments, display the generated QR code at checkout. Your customer can scan the QR code with their wallet app (such as Boom, Xverse, or Leather) to initiate the payment.



### **Step 4: Receive Payments in Your Wallet**

Once your customer completes the payment, the funds will be sent directly to your Stacks wallet. Here’s how to track and verify the payment:

1. **Check Your Wallet**:
   - Log into your wallet (Boom, Xverse, Leather, etc.) and monitor incoming transactions. Payments should appear shortly after they’ve been confirmed on the blockchain.

2. **Verify the Payment**:
   - Check the transaction details to ensure that the correct amount has been sent. The `spId` (Stacks Pay ID) in the memo field can help you confirm that the payment matches your specific request.
   
3. **Track the Payment on the Blockchain**:
   - Since Stacks Pay operates on the Stacks blockchain, you can view every transaction publicly on a blockchain explorer like [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co). Simply enter your Stacks address to view the payment status.



### **Step 5: Best Practices for Using Stacks Pay**

To ensure smooth payment processing for both you and your customers, follow these best practices:

- **Use Boom Wallet for Payment Generation**: For now, Boom Wallet is the only Stacks wallet that supports generating Stacks Pay payment links. Other wallets (such as Xverse or Leather) can receive payments but cannot generate Stacks Pay URLs.

- **Verify Payment Details**: Always double-check that the recipient address, amount, and description are correct before sharing the payment link.

- **Share Payment Links Securely**: When sharing links via email, messaging apps, or websites, ensure that they are transmitted securely. Always preview the link before sending to prevent errors.

- **Monitor Your Payments**: Keep an eye on your wallet for incoming transactions. For merchants handling multiple payments, use the `spId` to track and verify each transaction efficiently.

- **Secure Your Wallet**: For larger amounts, consider using a hardware wallet or enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your funds.

- **Respond Quickly to Payment Issues**: If a customer accidentally sends the wrong amount or experiences a payment issue, verify the transaction on the blockchain and address any concerns promptly.



### **Example: Accepting Donations with Stacks Pay**

Let’s say you run a nonprofit organization and want to accept donations in cryptocurrency. Here’s how you can use Stacks Pay to handle the process:

1. **Create the Donation Request**:
   - Open Boom Wallet and enter your Stacks address as the recipient.
   - Leave the amount field blank so that donors can decide how much they want to contribute.
   - Add a description like “Support Our Nonprofit”.
   - Generate the `spId` and payment request using Boom Wallet.

2. **Share the Payment Link**:
   - Copy the encoded payment link generated by Boom Wallet and include it in your donation emails or post it on your website.
   - Example: “Help us continue our work—donate using the link below: [Encoded Payment Link]”

3. **Donor Makes the Payment**:
   - The donor clicks the link or scans the QR code, and their wallet (Boom, Xverse, Leather, etc.) will open with the payment details filled in. They can enter their desired donation amount and complete the payment.

4. **Verify the Donation**:
   - You check your wallet to ensure the payment has been received. The `spId` in the memo field helps you confirm the donation was made for this specific request.



### **Next Steps for Merchants**

Now that you understand how to create and manage Stacks Pay payment requests, it’s time to integrate it into your business:

- **Use Boom Wallet or Boom Smart Shops**: Begin creating encoded payment links for your products, services, or donations.
  
- **Share Payment Links with Customers**: Whether through your website, email, or QR codes, make it easy for customers to pay using Stacks Pay.
