A comprehensive guide to implementing StacksPay payment acceptance in your business, from simple links to advanced integrations.

## Payment Types & Use Cases

### Fixed-Price Invoices
Perfect for: Product sales, service invoices, event tickets, subscriptions

**How it works**: Create a payment link with a specific amount that customers cannot change. When they click or scan, their wallet opens with the exact payment amount pre-filled.

**Business scenarios**:
- **E-commerce**: Product purchases with fixed prices
- **Service providers**: Predetermined service fees
- **Event organizers**: Ticket sales with set pricing
- **Subscriptions**: Monthly or annual service fees

**Real-world example**: Boom's Marketplace uses invoice links for each art piece. When a customer finds a $150 painting, they click the StacksPay link and pay exactly $150 - no confusion, no pricing errors.

### Support/Tip Payments
Perfect for: Content creators, service providers, donations, tips

**How it works**: Create a payment link where customers choose their own amount. The link includes your payment address and description, but lets the payer decide how much to send.

**Business scenarios**:
- **Content creators**: YouTube, blog, podcast support
- **Service industry**: Restaurant tips, delivery tips
- **Nonprofits**: Donation campaigns
- **Freelancers**: "Buy me a coffee" style support

**Real-world example**: Boom's Marketplace creators use tip links in their profiles. Fans can support their favorite artists with $5, $20, or any amount they choose.

### Digital Collectibles & Minting
Perfect for: Digital art, NFTs, limited editions, exclusive content

**How it works**: Create mint links that let customers purchase digital items directly. The transaction both pays you and transfers the digital asset to the customer.

**Business scenarios**:
- **Digital artists**: Selling unique artwork
- **Musicians**: Limited edition releases
- **Creators**: Exclusive content access
- **Brands**: Digital collectibles and loyalty rewards

**Real-world example**: Boom's Marketplace features digital collectibles where artists create unique pieces that customers can mint directly through StacksPay links.
