# Security Model

StacksPay's security model focuses on protecting users from malicious payment requests while maintaining the simplicity and interoperability that makes the protocol valuable.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. User Consent

**Explicit approval required**: Users must explicitly approve every payment before it's broadcast to the network.

**Clear information display**: Wallets must clearly show:
- Recipient address
- Amount being sent
- Token type
- Any additional fees
- Smart contract being called (for mint operations)

### 2. Data Integrity

**Bech32m checksums**: Built-in error detection prevents data corruption during transmission.

**Parameter validation**: All input parameters must be validated for type, format, and reasonable bounds.

**Encoding verification**: Invalid or malformed URLs must be rejected with clear error messages.

### 3. Temporal Security

**Expiration enforcement**: Wallets **MUST** enforce `expiresAt` parameters to prevent replay attacks.

**Time validation**: Expired payment requests **MUST** be rejected.

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. Malicious Payment Requests

**Threat**: Attacker creates payment request with malicious parameters.

**Mitigation**:
- Wallet validates all parameters
- User reviews transaction details before approval
- Clear display of recipient and amount
- Warning for unusual or suspicious requests

#### 2. Social Engineering

**Threat**: Attacker tricks user into scanning malicious QR code or clicking malicious link.

**Mitigation**:
- User education about verifying recipient addresses
- Wallet warnings for unusual patterns
- Clear transaction confirmation screens
- Amount limits and velocity checks

#### 3. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

**Threat**: Attacker intercepts and modifies payment request during transmission.

**Mitigation**:
- Bech32m checksums detect tampering
- HTTPS for web-based sharing
- Direct QR code scanning eliminates network transmission

#### 4. Replay Attacks

**Threat**: Attacker reuses old payment request to trigger duplicate payments.

**Mitigation**:
- Enforce `expiresAt` timestamps
- Unique `invoiceNumber` tracking
- Wallet transaction history checks

### Out-of-Scope Threats

- **Wallet security**: Private key management is the wallet's responsibility
- **Network attacks**: Stacks blockchain consensus security
- **Device security**: Physical device compromise
- **Social engineering**: Users voluntarily sharing private keys

## Security Requirements

### For Wallet Implementers

#### MUST Requirements

1. **Parameter validation**: All fields **MUST** be type-checked and length-checked
2. **Expiration enforcement**: Wallets **MUST** enforce `expiresAt` if present
3. **User confirmation**: Every payment **MUST** require explicit user approval
4. **Clear display**: Transaction details **MUST** be clearly shown to users
5. **Error handling**: Invalid requests **MUST** be rejected with clear error messages

#### SHOULD Requirements

1. **Post-conditions**: Wallets **SHOULD** add appropriate post-conditions limiting the transferred asset/amount
2. **Suspicious activity detection**: Wallets **SHOULD** warn users about unusual patterns
3. **Amount validation**: Wallets **SHOULD** validate amounts against reasonable bounds
4. **Address validation**: Wallets **SHOULD** verify recipient addresses are valid

#### MAY Requirements

1. **Transaction limits**: Wallets **MAY** implement per-transaction or daily limits
2. **Whitelist/blacklist**: Wallets **MAY** maintain lists of known good/bad addresses
3. **Risk scoring**: Wallets **MAY** implement risk analysis for payment requests

### For Application Developers

#### MUST Requirements

1. **Secure generation**: Generate payment requests server-side when possible
2. **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs before creating payment requests
3. **Expiration times**: Set reasonable `expiresAt` values for time-sensitive requests
4. **Error handling**: Handle encoding/decoding errors gracefully

#### SHOULD Requirements

1. **Fresh timestamps**: Regenerate `expiresAt` for time-sensitive invoices
2. **Unique references**: Use unique `invoiceNumber` values
3. **Secure storage**: Store payment request templates securely
4. **Audit logging**: Log payment request generation and usage

## Privacy Considerations

### On-Chain Privacy

**Memo field warning**: Memo fields are stored on-chain and are publicly visible. Wallets **MUST NOT** write sensitive data to memo fields.

**Transaction privacy**: All Stacks transactions are public. Users should be aware that:
- Transaction amounts are visible
- Recipient addresses are visible  
- Transaction timing is visible
- Smart contract interactions are visible

### Off-Chain Privacy

**URL sharing**: Payment request URLs may be logged by:
- Web servers
- Messaging platforms
- Analytics tools
- Network infrastructure

**QR codes**: QR codes may be captured by:
- Surveillance cameras
- Screenshots
- Photo sharing

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Verify recipients**: Always verify recipient addresses before sending payments
2. **Check amounts**: Carefully review payment amounts before confirming
3. **Validate requests**: Be suspicious of unexpected payment requests
4. **Keep software updated**: Use updated wallets with latest security patches
5. **Secure devices**: Keep devices secure and use device locks

### For Merchants

1. **Generate fresh requests**: Create new payment requests for each transaction
2. **Monitor expiration**: Set appropriate expiration times
3. **Validate payments**: Verify received payments match generated requests
4. **Secure systems**: Protect payment generation systems
5. **Audit trails**: Maintain logs of payment request generation

### For Developers

1. **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs thoroughly
2. **Error handling**: Provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive information
3. **Security testing**: Test for common attack vectors
4. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Documentation**: Clearly document security considerations

## Smart Contract Security

### Mint Operation Risks

**Contract validation**: When using `mint` operations, wallets should:
- Verify contract addresses are legitimate
- Check contract source code when possible
- Warn users about calling unknown contracts
- Validate function names and parameters

**Known contract patterns**: Wallets **MAY** maintain a whitelist of known safe contract patterns (e.g., popular NFT marketplaces).

### Custom Operations

**Vendor-specific risks**: Custom operations carry additional risks:
- Unknown parameter validation
- Unpredictable wallet behavior
- Potential for vendor lock-in
- Reduced interoperability

**Handling guidelines**: Wallets encountering custom operations **SHOULD**:
- Warn users about unknown operation types
- Provide safe defaults when possible
- Fail gracefully to prevent unexpected behavior

## Incident Response

### Vulnerability Disclosure

**Responsible disclosure**: Security vulnerabilities should be reported to:
- Wallet developers
- StacksPay specification maintainers
- Stacks community security channels

**Coordination**: Critical vulnerabilities may require coordinated disclosure across multiple wallet implementations.

### Emergency Procedures

**Rapid response**: Critical security issues may require:
- Emergency wallet updates
- Temporary protocol modifications
- Community alerts
- Documentation updates

## Security Auditing

### Implementation Review

**Regular audits**: Wallet implementations should undergo regular security audits focusing on:
- Parameter validation
- Error handling
- User interface security
- Cryptographic implementation

**Test vectors**: Comprehensive test vectors should include:
- Malformed inputs
- Edge cases
- Attack scenarios
- Boundary conditions

### Continuous Monitoring

**Threat intelligence**: Monitor for:
- New attack patterns
- Malicious contract deployments
- Suspicious transaction patterns
- Community reports of issues
