### **What You’ll Need**

To make a payment using Stacks Pay, you'll need the following:

1. **A Stacks-Compatible Wallet**: You’ll need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports the Stacks blockchain. Popular options include:
   - [Boom Wallet](https://www.boomwallet.app)
   - [Xverse Wallet](https://www.xverse.app/)
   - [Leather Wallet](https://leather.io/)
   
2. **STX Tokens or SIP-010 Tokens**: The payment will be made in Stacks’ native cryptocurrency (STX) or in SIP-010 tokens, depending on the request.



### **Step-by-Step Guide: Making a Payment with Stacks Pay**

Stacks Pay makes it easy to pay with cryptocurrency by using an encoded URL or QR code. Here's a simple, step-by-step guide on how to complete a payment using your Stacks wallet.

#### **Step 1: Open the Payment Link or Scan the QR Code**

You’ll receive the payment request from the merchant in one of two ways:

- **Payment Link**: The merchant will send you a Stacks Pay URL (in an encoded format). Clicking the link will automatically open your wallet with the payment details pre-filled.
- **QR Code**: If the payment request is provided as a QR code (common for in-person payments), open your wallet and use its built-in QR scanner to scan the code.

Your wallet will then decode the link and display the payment details.



#### **Step 2: Review the Payment Details**

Once the payment link is opened in your wallet, you’ll be able to see the pre-filled details of the payment request. These details typically include:

- **Recipient**: The merchant’s Stacks address.
- **Amount**: The specified amount of STX or SIP-010 tokens. For donation links or open-ended requests, the amount may be blank, and you will be prompted to enter the desired amount.
- **Description**: A short description provided by the merchant, giving context to the payment (e.g., “Payment for Service”).
- **Memo**: Optional but may contain additional details such as the Stacks Pay ID (`spId`), which helps the merchant track the payment.

Be sure to double-check that all the information looks correct, particularly the recipient address and the amount.



#### **Step 3: Confirm and Authorize the Payment**

Once you’ve reviewed the payment details, you can proceed to confirm the payment.

1. **Enter the Payment Amount (if required)**:
   - For donations or payments where the amount is not pre-set, your wallet will prompt you to enter the amount you wish to send. Input the correct amount based on the merchant’s request.

2. **Authorize the Payment**:
   - Confirm that the payment details are correct.
   - Click the **Send** or **Pay** button in your wallet to authorize the transaction.
   - Depending on your wallet’s security settings, you may be asked to confirm the payment with additional security features, such as a password or two-factor authentication (2FA).



#### **Step 4: Wait for Transaction Confirmation**

Once the payment is authorized, your wallet will process the transaction on the Stacks blockchain. Here’s what to expect:

- **Pending Confirmation**: Most wallets will show the transaction as "pending" until it is confirmed on the blockchain. The confirmation process may take a few minutes, depending on network conditions.
- **Transaction Details**: You can view the transaction details in your wallet, including the amount sent, the recipient’s address, and the status of the transaction.



### **How to Verify a Payment**

Once the payment is made, both you and the merchant can verify it using the Stacks blockchain.

1. **Check Your Wallet’s Transaction History**:
   - Open your wallet and navigate to the transaction history. You should see the payment listed as "completed" once it’s confirmed on the blockchain.
   
2. **Use a Blockchain Explorer**:
   - You can also verify the payment using the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co) by entering your Stacks address. This will show all transactions associated with your address, including the payment you just made.

3. **Confirm Payment with the Merchant**:
   - If necessary, you can share the transaction ID with the merchant to confirm that the payment has been received. The merchant can also verify the payment on the blockchain.



### **Example: Paying for a Product with Stacks Pay**

Let’s say you’re purchasing an item online from a merchant using Stacks Pay. Here’s a practical example of how the process works:

1. **The merchant sends you a payment link** via email after you place an order for a product worth 500 STX.
   - Example link (encoded): `stxpay1qxxjs4dkt2ql8wzff4ny5vzxxxyhgq6wt9ss`
   
2. **Click the link**, and it opens in your Boom Wallet or Xverse Wallet with the payment details filled in:
   - Recipient: SP2YDB...
   - Amount: 500 STX
   - Description: “Payment for Handcrafted Jewelry”
   
3. **Review the details** and confirm that everything is correct.
   
4. **Click "Pay"**, and Boom Wallet processes the payment, sending 500 STX to the merchant’s address.

5. **Check the payment status** in your wallet’s transaction history. You see that the payment is confirmed and has been recorded on the blockchain.

6. The merchant confirms receipt of the payment and ships your order.



### **Common Payment Issues and Solutions**

While Stacks Pay is designed to be straightforward, here are some common issues users may encounter and how to resolve them:

1. **Payment Link Doesn’t Open in Your Wallet**:
   - Ensure that your wallet supports Stacks Pay links. Currently, **Boom Wallet** is the only wallet that supports generating Stacks Pay links, but **Xverse** and **Leather** wallets can still process the payment if the link is decoded properly.
   - If you have issues opening the link, try copying it manually into your wallet’s “Send” function.

2. **The Amount Is Not Set in the Payment Request**:
   - For donations or flexible payment requests, you’ll need to manually enter the amount. Double-check with the merchant if you’re unsure of the correct amount to send.

3. **The Payment Is Taking Too Long to Confirm**:
   - While payments on the Stacks blockchain are generally quick, network congestion or issues can cause delays. You can monitor the status of the transaction in your wallet or use the Stacks Explorer to check its progress.

4. **Incorrect Amount Sent**:
   - If you accidentally send the wrong amount, contact the merchant to resolve the issue. They can verify the transaction on the blockchain and work with you to send any adjustments.



### **Security Tips for Paying with Stacks Pay**

Here are some best practices to ensure your payments are secure:

- **Double-Check Payment Details**: Always verify the recipient address and the amount before confirming a payment. Once a blockchain transaction is sent, it cannot be reversed.
  
- **Use a Secure Wallet**: Make sure your wallet is up-to-date and secured with strong passwords or two-factor authentication (2FA). Consider using a hardware wallet for larger transactions.

- **Beware of Phishing Links**: Only click on payment links from trusted sources. If you receive a suspicious link, confirm with the merchant before proceeding.
